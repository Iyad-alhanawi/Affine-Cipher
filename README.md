# Affine Cipher 

## Overview

This Python program implements the Affine cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It enables users to perform both encryption and decryption with a given plaintext or ciphertext, along with two numeric cipher keys. The program ensures that the first key is coprime to 26, facilitating valid encryption and decryption processes. By handling both alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, the program provides a user-friendly interface for cryptographic operations.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Users can encrypt plaintext or decrypt ciphertext using the Affine cipher.
- **Input Validation**: The program checks that the first cipher key is coprime to 26 to ensure valid operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple prompts guide users through the encryption and decryption processes.
- **Handling of Non-Alphabetic Characters**: The program preserves spaces and non-alphabetic characters in the output.


## Usage
### Run the Program
Execute the script in your Python environment.

### Choose Operation
- Type `encryption` to encrypt text.
- Type `decryption` to decrypt text.

### Input
- For encryption: Enter the plaintext.
- For decryption: Enter the ciphertext.
- Enter your first cipher key (integer)
- Enter your second cipher key (integer)


### Output
The program will display the encrypted or decrypted text.
